<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/">130. Surrounded Regions
</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given an m x n matrix board containing letters 'X' and 'O', capture regions that are surrounded:

Connect: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
Region: To form a region connect every 'O' cell.
Surround: The region is surrounded with 'X' cells if you can connect the region with 'X' cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the board.
A surrounded region is captured by replacing all 'O's with 'X's in the input matrix board.

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> board = [["X"]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [["X"]]
