<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/">133. Clone Graph
</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png" style="width: 400px; height: 277px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png" style="width: 400px; height: 277px;">
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> adjList = [[]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> adjList = []
<strong>Output:</strong> []
<strong>Explanation:</strong>  This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the graph is in the range <code>[0, 100]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>1 <= Node.val <= 100</code></li>
    <li><code>Node.val</code> is unique for each node.</li>
    <li>There are no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.</li>
    <li>The Graph is connected and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node.</li>
</ul>
