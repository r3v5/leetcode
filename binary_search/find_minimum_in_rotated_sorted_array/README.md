<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/">153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [11,13,15,17]
<strong>Output:</strong> 11
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
</pre>

    <li><code>-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000</code></li>
    <li>All the integers of nums are unique.</li>
    <li>nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.</li>
