<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/">11. Container With Most Water
</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
<strong>Output:</strong> 49
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> height = [1,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>n == height.length</code>.</li>
	<li><code>2 <= n <= 10^5</code></li>
    <li><code>0 <= height[i] <= 10^4</code><li>
</ul>
